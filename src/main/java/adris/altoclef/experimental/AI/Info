Experimental AI Task System

Currently Done:
- Utils (1%)
- RewardSystem (0%)
- Tasks (0%)

Current Things to Add:
- Save AI Data to File to continue Learning every Session
- AI Debugger (Output information about the AI e.g Stats, Values, Task History and AI Current Thoughts)
- Dynamic Task System
- Add something to fallback onto if the AI is stuck / Broken so that it can hopefully save itself enough to rerun the AI Task
- Discord Webhook Support (Send Notification is Bot is Potentially Stuck)
- Send Tasks to AI over Discord
- Send Screenshot to Discord Webhook
- Send Inventory Screenshot to Discord Webhook
- Send AI Debugger Output to Discord Webhook
